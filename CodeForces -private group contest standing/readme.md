# Codeforces Contest Scraper

This script logs in to Codeforces, navigates to a specific group contest standings page, and scrapes the user standings data. It then saves the data in an Excel file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium library (`pip install selenium`)
- ChromeDriver - Ensure that ChromeDriver is installed and its path is added to the system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium openpyxl
   ```

3. Update the `username`, `password`, `groupId`, and `contestId` variables in the script with your Codeforces credentials and the contest details.
4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python codeforces_scraper.py
   ```

5. The script will open a Chrome browser, log in to Codeforces, and scrape the contest standings.
6. The results will be saved in an Excel file named `contest-{contestId}.xlsx` in the same directory.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace the placeholder credentials (`username`, `password`, `groupId`, `contestId`) with your actual Codeforces credentials and contest details.
- The script uses the Chrome browser, so ensure you have Chrome installed and the appropriate version of ChromeDriver for your browser.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided as-is. Use it responsibly and be aware of Codeforces' terms of service regarding web scraping.
